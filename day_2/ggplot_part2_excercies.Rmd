## Using multiple geoms 

-this is a more typical form a violin plot, showing both the violin distribution and box plot quantiles. Use multiple geoms to try and recreate this plot. This was generated using the `ToothGrowth` data set. Remember you can use the `?` command to look at the parameters for each geom 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../src/example_vio_box.png')
```

```{r}
data("ToothGrowth")
```

## faceting plots 

- Remember the bubble plot we made yesterday using the gapminder data set? We're going to re plot it
- This time use `facet_wrap` to split the data up by continent and make a facted plot. Additionally, add labels for the country names for three countries from each continent

```{r}

```


## creating a complicated plot

- Imagine the following scenario - You're assaying the activity of an enzyme and a hyperactive mutant. Your using a reporter assay that measures the activity in "scientific units"(SU).
- You assay the activity over 24 hours, but realize that when you left the lab the AC turned on and lowered the temperature of the room which may have lowered the temperature.
- this data is stored in .'./src/Reporter_assay_results.tsv.gz'
- Use this data to recreate the following plot

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../src/reporter_assay_plot.png')
```

- some hints: 
  - you will need to reshape the data, and calculate the average SU at each time point. (try using groupby and summarise)
  - the following geoms are required: `geom_line`, `geom_label`, `geom_label_repel`, `geom_vline` and `geom_errorbar`. You will have to change several theme settings, and scale at least one aesthtic for one of the geoms

```{r}

```


## dumbell plots
- this is dumbbell plot. 
![](../src/dumbell_plot.png)

- the are analgous to a dodged bar plot, where the height, or in this case width, corresponds to the number of cases 
- the data for this plot is in the file '../src/health.csv.gz'
couple hints: you will need to sort this data before plotting it. Remember how discrete axes are ordered in ggplot

```{r}
write_tsv(data, '../src/US_health.tsv.gz')
```
