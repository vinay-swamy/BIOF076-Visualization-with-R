## Practice with themes 

We're going to work with one of the plots we made earlier 


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=manufacturer, fill = class)) 
```



Assign descriptive axis labels and a plot title to the plot
```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=manufacturer, fill = class))  + 
  xlab('Car Manufacturer') + 
  ylab('Number of Cars') + 
  ggtitle('Car Production')
```

fix the labels similar to how it was done in the example

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=manufacturer, fill = class))  + 
  xlab('Car Manufacturer') + 
  ylab('Number of Cars') + 
  ggtitle('Car Production') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
    

```


change the y axis title so it is parallel to the x axis title 

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=manufacturer, fill = class))  + 
  xlab('Car Manufacturer') + 
  ylab('Number of Cars') + 
  ggtitle('Car Production') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
        axis.title.y =  element_text(angle = 0))
```

change the font of the title to AvantGarde, the color to red

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=manufacturer, fill = class))  + 
  xlab('Car Manufacturer') + 
  ylab('Number of Cars') + 
  ggtitle('Car Production') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
        axis.title.y =  element_text(angle = 0), 
        text = element_text(family = 'Palatino'))

```





now use guide to reposition the legend to the top of the plot 
```{r}


```



## practice with colors
- We'll be working with the `storms` data set in dplyr library(we havent covered this yet, but we will) for this part 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data("storms")
storms
```

make a violin plot for `pressure`, using `status` as the x variable. Give axes appropriate titles. 

```{r}

```

explore the palettes in the `pals` package. I've written a function to let you plot color palletes 
```{r}
install.packages('pals')
install.packages('patchwork')
```




```{r}
library(pals)
library(patchwork)
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
source('../src/plot_pal.R')
plot_pal(pals::plasma(100))

```

pick a palette and use the appriate `scale_..._discrete` function to color your plot based on the `status` column

```{r}


```



now pick colors from different palettes, and use them as part of a `scale_...manual`. 

```{r}
```


```{r}

```


make a scatter plot of `wind` vs `pressure`, using the `category` to color the points using a contionus scale. make sure `category` is a continous variable
```{r}

```

## customizing multiple aesthetics 

- the `gapminder` dataset is a popular example dataset about the life expectancy, GDP and population for differnt countries across the world 
![](../src/gapminder_bubbleplot.png)


- this is a bubble plot. We're going to remake this plot with ggplot.
- gdpPercap as the x axis 
- lifeExp as the y axis
- pop as the point size
- continent as the color
- alpha changed globally

```{r, fig.height=4}

library(readr)
data <- read_tsv('../src/gapminder_2007.tsv.gz')
```
