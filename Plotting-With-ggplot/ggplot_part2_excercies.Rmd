## Using multiple geoms 

- this is a more typical form a violin plot, showing both the violin distribution and box plot quantiles. Use multiple geoms to try and recreate this plot. This was generated using the `ToothGrowth` data set. Remember you can use the `?` command to look at the parameters for each geom. use the `ggsave` function to save the plot to disk, and set the ouptut dimensions accordingly to match the example

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../src/example_vio_box.png')
```


```{r ex_1}
data("ToothGrowth") 
ToothGrowth

```

## faceting plots 

- Remember the bubble plot we made yesterday using the gapminder data set? We're going to re plot it
- This time use `facet_wrap` to split the data up by continent and make a facted plot. Additionally, add labels for the country names for three countries from each continent
    - you will make a separate data.frame for the labels 

```{r ex_2}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
install.packages('ggrepel')

data <- read_tsv('../src/gapminder_2007.tsv.gz') 



```


## creating a complicated plot

- Imagine the following scenario - You're assaying the activity of an enzyme and a hyperactive mutant. Your using a reporter assay that measures the activity in "scientific units"(SU).
- You assay the activity over 24 hours, but realize that when you left the lab the AC turned on and lowered the temperature of the room which may have lowered the temperature.
- this data is stored in '../src/Reporter_assay_results.tsv.gz'
- Use this data to recreate the following plot

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../src/reporter_assay_plot.png')
```

This is a bit a of a tough one,so some hints: 
- you will need to reshape the data from wide to long, and calculate the mean, standard deviation, and number of observations at each time point-condition grouping. (try using groupby and summarise)
    - the `n()` function gives the number of observations in a group
- use the  summarized data to calculate standard error(see slides for formula )
- the following geoms are required: `geom_line`, `geom_point`, `geom_label_repel`, `geom_vline` and `geom_errorbar`. You will have to change several theme settings, and scale at least one aesthetic for one of the geoms

- to change the point shapes, you will need to use `scale_shape_manual`. We have not directly covered how to do this, but for some real-life practice, try googling it.

```{r ex_3}
data <- read_tsv('../src/Reporter_assay_results.tsv.gz')

```


## dumbell plots
- this is dumbbell plot. 
![](../src/dumbell_plot.png)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../src/dumbell_plot.png')
```

- the are analgous to a dodged bar plot, where the height, or in this case width, corresponds to the number of cases 
- the data for this plot is in the file '../src/health.csv.gz'
couple hints: you will need to sort this data before plotting it. Remember how discrete axes are ordered in ggplot with factors.
- We have not directly covered how to change axis ticks, but look through the documentation of `scale_x_contionus` for some help

```{r ex_4}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_tsv( '../src/US_health.tsv.gz') 


```
