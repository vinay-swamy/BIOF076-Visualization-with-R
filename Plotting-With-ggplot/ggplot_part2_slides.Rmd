## Using multiple geoms in a plot
- Up until now we have been using one `geom_` layer in a plot, which often does the trick; but sometimes, we want to include multiple geoms in the same plot

- for example, fitting a line to some points; we want both the points and the fitted line

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) +
    geom_point(aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + 
    theme_minimal()

```

## Using multiple geoms in a plot

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
    theme_minimal()
```

- notice how I set the `aes` within the `ggplot` function. When you provide an aesthetic mapping in the `ggplot` function, it  *globally* defines aesthetics for all geoms in the plot

## Using multiple geoms in a plot

- we can even do this with two different data sets; Suppose for example that I want to make a box plot, but I want to add a point for the max and min for each data set.

```{r}
ggplot(data =iris) + 
    geom_boxplot( aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length)) + 
    theme_classic()

```

- while box plots normally show points for outliers, I want to max it more obvious

## Using multiple geoms in a plot

- first lets reshape some data 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
iris_min_max <- iris %>% 
    select(Species, Petal.Length) %>% 
    group_by(Species) %>% 
    summarise(max = max(Petal.Length), 
              min= min(Petal.Length)) %>% 
    tidyr::pivot_longer(-Species)
iris_min_max
```

## Using multiple geoms in a plot

```{r}
ggplot() + 
    geom_boxplot(data =iris, aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length)) + 
    geom_point(data = iris_min_max, aes(x=Species, y=value), color='red')+
    theme_classic()

```
- like `aes` when we provide the an input for the `data` parameter in `ggplot`, it is set for globally, but we can also choose to use different in each `geom` layer

## Using multiple geoms in a plot

- notice what happens when I flip the order of the geoms 

```{r}
ggplot() + 
    geom_point(data = iris_min_max, aes(x=Species, y=value), color='red')+
    geom_boxplot(data =iris, aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length)) + 
    theme_classic()
```

- layers are always plotted the in the order they are provided

## adding labels to plots 
- we often want to label specific data points or values within out plots within out plots, we can do this with `geom_label` or `geom_text`

- Consider the following scatter plot. Lets say I want to add labels to show the model of car for the points with the highest mpg
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% mutate(name = rownames(.))
ggplot(mtcars) + 
    geom_point(aes(x=qsec, y= mpg))
```

## adding labels to plots

```{r}
top5_mpg <-  mtcars %>% select(name, mpg, qsec) %>% arrange(desc(mpg)) %>% head(5)

ggplot() + 
    geom_point(data = mtcars, aes(x=qsec, y= mpg)) + 
    geom_label(data = top5_mpg,aes(x=qsec, y= mpg, label = name)) 

```
- this works, but doesn't look super clean. If these points were more dense, the labels might hide them ; because the location of the labels need to be specified before hand, it can be difficult to use the vanilla `geom_text` or `geom_label`. 

## `ggrepel`

- the package `ggrepel` provides some improved functions for labeling, namely `geom_text_repel` and `geom_label_repel`. Both are drop-in replacements for `geom_text` and `geom_label` respectively

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot() + 
    geom_point(data = mtcars, aes(x=qsec, y= mpg)) + 
    geom_label_repel(data = top5_mpg,aes(x=qsec, y= mpg, label = name))
```
- the `_repel` labeling functions will automagically space them selves away from points, while simultaneously avoiding other elements in the plot.

## `ggrepel`

- when the points get too far, lines will be drawn to show which label corresponds to which location
```{r}
library(ggrepel)
 ggplot() + 
    geom_point(data = mtcars, aes(x=qsec, y= mpg)) + 
    geom_label_repel(data = top5_mpg,aes(x=qsec, y= mpg, label = name), nudge_y = 2)
```

## error bars
- error bars are a fundamental part of scientific plots, and are supported in ggplot with `geom_errorbar`

- for example, lets make a bar plot for the Petal width in the iris data, and show the error bars for the measurement; I'll using the [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) as the type of error for the measurement. The formula for standard error is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$,  where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $n$ is the number of samples;

## error bars

```{r}
# first calculate the average length for each flower specie
avg_petal_width <- iris %>% 
    select(Species, Petal.Width) %>% 
    group_by(Species) %>% 
    summarise(avg_width = mean(Petal.Width), 
              sdev_width = sd(Petal.Width), 
              n = n()) %>% 
    mutate(std_err =sdev_width/sqrt(n))
avg_petal_width

```

## error bars

- now make the plot with error bars

```{r}
ggplot(avg_petal_width) + 
    geom_col(aes(x=Species, y=avg_width, fill = ), width = .5) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(x=Species, ymin = avg_width - std_err, ymax = avg_width + std_err),  width = .5) 
```

## error bars
- not bad but could be a little prettier

```{r}
ggplot(avg_petal_width) + 
    geom_errorbar(aes(x=Species, ymin = avg_width - std_err, ymax = avg_width + std_err),  width = .5)  + 
    geom_col(aes(x=Species, y=avg_width, fill = Species ), width = .5) +
    xlab('Iris Subspecies') + 
    ylab('Petal Width') + 
    ggtitle('Iris Petal Width Across Subspecies') + 
    theme_classic()
```

## ordering discrete axes
- here's a simple bar plot. I'm summarizing the data to count the number of entries for each, and then using `geom_col`
```{r}
data(mpg)
mpg_count <- mpg %>% group_by(class) %>% summarise(count = n())
ggplot(mpg_count) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=class, y=count, fill = class))
```

## ordering discrete axes
- suppose i want to order bars that they from smallest to largest. Lets try ordering the data first
```{r}
mpg_count_arranges <- mpg_count %>% arrange(count)
ggplot(mpg_count_arranges) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=class, y=count, fill = class))
```

## ordering discrete axes
- This doesn't work because under the hood, ggplot converts all character vectors to factors
- when a character is converted to a factor, the factor is arranged in alphabetical order
- when you order a dataframe,  to maintain the ordering you must convert any character columns you want to include in the plot to factors

## ordering discrete axes
```{r}
mpg_count_arranges <- mpg_count %>% arrange(count) %>% mutate(class = factor(class, levels = class))
ggplot(mpg_count_arranges) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=class, y=count, fill = class))
```

## making faceted plots
- it can be useful to show the same plot across multiple conditions. 

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=manufacturer, y=cty)) + 
  facet_wrap(~class) + 
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

- this is generally useful when you have a categorical variable that has subtypes.
